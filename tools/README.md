# Convert BMP to CLK
If you're on Windows, check out the `Prepare_images` folder. There's a GUI exe program (written in Pascal on Delphi IDE).


If you're not on Windows, you can use the Python script `conv-bmp-to-clk.py`. Full disclosure, it's a ChatGPT "conversion" of the Pascal code from `Prepare_images`. @bitrot_alpha tested it and it appears to work. It needs the Python Pillow library installed on your machine.
